**Technical Support Information**

If you want support regardless if it's on discord or in a ticket, We need some information from you other than the problem you are having. Before posting, PLEASE, make sure you are up to date with Shadow & Light AND ElvUI.  Verify this by doing ```/estatus``` and compare the ElvUI version to the download and Shadow & Light version to the client as well.
You will need to do ```/slerror on``` which will  **DISABLE ALL** addons except for ElvUI and S&L to try to reproduce the issue. It is important that you do that so we can narrow down what is causing the problem faster than repeating the same thing to people.
